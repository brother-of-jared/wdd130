    <h1>My Favorite City</h1>
    <p>My favorite city is Baguio City, Benguet, Philippines. It is known as the "Summer Capital of the Philippines",
        owing to the city's cool climate relative to the lowlands. With an approximate elevation of 1,500 meters (4,900
        feet) above mean sea level, Baguio belongs to the Luzon tropical pine forests eco region; the climate is
        conducive for the growth of mossy plants, orchids and pine trees, to which it attributes its other moniker as
        the "City of Pines".</p>
