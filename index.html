        <p>Hello, my name is Mahonri Balajadia, and I am from the Philippines. My hobbies are playing sports, gaming,
            reading, singing, and watching. I'm taking this class because I want to learn on how to become a web
            developer. I'm looking forward to working with all of you this semester.</p>

        <p>The Rice Terraces of Banaue are perhaps the most well-known attraction in the Philippines, and no list of the
            Seven
            Wonders of the Philippines would be complete without them. Located in central Luzon, these terraces have
            been carved by
            local Ifugao people over the last 3,000 thousand years.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you visit, you can see terraces still being built today. Locals often describe the terraces as the
            largest man-made
            structure created without forced labor. If each terrace were laid end to end, they would stretch almost
            14,000 miles.
            They were declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1995 and are one of 6 UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the
            Philippines.
