            <p>Hello, my name is Mahonri Balajadia, and I am from the Philippines. I am one of five children and
                recently
                got married in the temple. My hobbies are playing sports, gaming, reading, singing, and watching. When I
                was
                young, my siblings and I helped our parents with their printing business. They hired a
                tutor for us to learn some basic troubleshooting with computer and printers so whenever there's a
                problem we don't have to call for a technician or bring the computer or printer to a repair shop. I'm
                really
                grateful to have that experience because that is where I started to develop my passion with the
                modern technology. I'm taking this class because I want to learn the knowledge and skills to become a
                web
                developer. I'm
                looking forward to working with all of you this semester. Good luck to us!</p>

            <p>The Rice Terraces of Banaue are perhaps the most well-known attraction in the Philippines, and no list of
                the
                Seven
                Wonders of the Philippines would be complete without them. Located in central Luzon, these terraces have
                been carved by
                local Ifugao people over the last 3,000 thousand years.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you visit, you can see terraces still being built today. Locals often describe the terraces as the
                largest man-made
                structure created without forced labor. If each terrace were laid end to end, they would stretch almost
                14,000 miles.
                They were declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1995 and are one of 6 UNESCO World Heritage Sites in
                the
                Philippines.
