            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Rapid Quest Rafting was founded in 2012 by a group of outdoor enthusiasts and experienced river guides
                who shared a
                passion for white-water adventure. Starting with just two rafts on the Cagayan River in the Philippines,
                the company’s
                vision was to make rafting safe, thrilling, and accessible to everyone. Over the years, Rapid Quest
                Rafting built a
                reputation for excellence through its focus on safety standards, environmental stewardship, and customer
                experience. By
                2018, the company expanded its operations to include multiple river routes, eco-tourism activities, and
                training
                programs for aspiring guides. Today, Rapid Quest Rafting stands as one of the region’s most trusted
                adventure
                outfitters, continuing to deliver unforgettable journeys for thrill-seekers and nature lovers alike.</p>
